# LEVITATION

**Description:** Acoustic levitation system for micro-manipulation  
**Location:** MIT | Cambridge, MA

## Project Overview

This project developed an acoustic levitation system capable of suspending and manipulating small objects in mid-air using precisely controlled sound waves. The system was designed for applications in micro-manufacturing and materials science research.

## Technical Implementation

The levitation system utilized phased array transducers to create standing wave patterns that could trap and move objects with micron precision. Key challenges included achieving stable levitation over extended periods and developing precise control algorithms for object manipulation.

## Applications

The system demonstrated potential applications in contactless handling of delicate materials, micro-assembly processes, and fundamental research in fluid dynamics and materials science. The technology showed particular promise for handling sensitive biological samples and microelectronic components.
