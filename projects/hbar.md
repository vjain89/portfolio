# H-BAR

**Description:** High-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator  
**Location:** Yale Quantum Institute | New Haven, CT

## Project Overview

This project involved the design and implementation of a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (H-BAR) for quantum computing applications. The resonator operates at microwave frequencies and provides the necessary coherence times for quantum information processing.

## Technical Details

The H-BAR design required careful consideration of material properties, geometric constraints, and electromagnetic field distributions. Key challenges included achieving high quality factors while maintaining compatibility with existing quantum computing architectures.

## Implementation

The project utilized advanced microfabrication techniques and involved extensive simulation and testing phases. The final design demonstrated excellent performance characteristics suitable for integration into larger quantum computing systems.
