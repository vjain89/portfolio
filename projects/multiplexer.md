# MULTIPLEXER

**Description:** High-speed optical multiplexer for data center applications  
**Location:** UC Berkeley | Berkeley, CA

## Project Overview

This project designed and implemented a high-speed optical multiplexer capable of handling multiple data streams simultaneously for next-generation data center networks. The system was optimized for low latency and high bandwidth requirements.

## Technical Specifications

The multiplexer operated at 100 Gbps per channel with support for up to 16 simultaneous channels. Key design considerations included signal integrity, power efficiency, and thermal management for continuous operation in data center environments.

## Performance Optimization

Extensive testing and optimization focused on minimizing signal degradation and maximizing throughput. The final design achieved industry-leading performance metrics while maintaining compatibility with existing network infrastructure.
